### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I love building things that help other developers build things. Currently, I'm focused on [Scarf](https://scarf.sh) - We make tools that help open-source maintainers understand which companies are using their software commercially and then work to help them broker well-paying support agreements with those companies. This topic has been an obsession of mine, so please don't hesitate to reach out to chat about it! 

You can reach me via [email](mailto:mail@avi.press), [Twitter](twitter.com/avi_press), or [Keybase](https://keybase.io/aviaviavi).
