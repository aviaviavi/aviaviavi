### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm working on [Scarf](https://scarf.sh). We build advanced, maintainer-friendly tools for open source software distribution, helping developers understand how their open-source is actually being used - and by which companies.

You can reach me via [Keybase](https://keybase.io/aviaviavi), [email](mailto:mail@avi.press), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/avi_press).
