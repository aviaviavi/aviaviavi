### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I write dev tools. Currently, I'm focused on [Scarf](https://scarf.sh) - We make tools that help open-source maintainers understand which companies are using their software commercially and then work to help them broker well-paying support agreements with those companies. 

You can reach me via [Keybase](https://keybase.io/aviaviavi), [email](mailto:mail@avi.press), or [Twitter](twitter.com/avi_press).
