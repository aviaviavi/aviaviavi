### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm the founder & CEO of [Scarf](https://scarf.sh). We help open source projects understand how their projects are being used. I'm also currently serving on the [Haskell.org](https://haskell.org) committe.

You can reach me via [email](mailto:mail@avi.press), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/avi_press), and maybe even [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/avi.press).
